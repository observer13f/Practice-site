              <p>If someone would have told me a week ago that i would be
                <em>able</em> to make a <strong>website</strong>, I would <b>not</b> have
                believed them. </p><p> Just a few days later, I came across
                  Mimo and started to work on a real site. With help from Mimo
                   and other sites like
                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_attributes.asp">
                  w3schools</a> and a few others!</p>

              <div class="post-content">
                <p> Mimo has multiple challenges at the end of a chapter;
                  Bronze, Silver, and Gold. My bronze challange was to change
                  some emphasis and some bolding in my previous post. Also i
                  had to link an external website in the text. My silver
                  challenge was to change the contact option to directly
                  email me if anyone clicks it! My gold challange was to
                  create another blog post with new title and author. i changed
                  the title but im not too sure about how to change the author
                  so i just changed the div class to "post-author1".</p>
